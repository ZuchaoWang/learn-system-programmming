# learn-system-programmming

This is some C code for system programming, inspired by a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OSeJFo6GOc) and a [course book](https://man7.org/tlpi/).

Although the code is intended for Linux, it should run in most UNIX-like system. In fact, I write and execute the code in Mac OS.

Most propgrams are compiled with `gcc xxx.c`, but `producer_consumer_mutex.c` should be compiled with `gcc -pthread xxx.c`.
